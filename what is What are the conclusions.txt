ðŸŽ¯ Performance Analysis & Conclusions
Based on your training data, here's what the recommendations mean:
ðŸ“Š The Problem: Severe Training Instability
Your training shows classic signs of gradient explosion and optimization instability:

19.8x loss increase from start to peak (48 â†’ 959)
7 out of 9 epoch intervals had jumps >100 loss points
Average volatility of 206 (should be <10 for stable training)
Loss oscillation between 560-800 in later epochs

ðŸŽ¯ Why These Recommendations Work
1. Learning Rate Reduction (1e-4 â†’ 1e-5/1e-6)
Current: 0.0001 â†’ Too aggressive for VQ-VAE
Recommended: 0.00001 â†’ Smaller steps prevent overshooting


Your loss explosion at epoch 39-49 indicates the optimizer is taking steps too large for the loss landscape.
2. Batch Size Reduction (16 â†’ 4-8)

Current: 16 samples â†’ High gradient variance on CPU
Recommended: 4-8 â†’ More stable gradients, less memory pressure


CPU training with large batches creates noisy gradients that amplify instability.
3. Model Size Reduction
Current: latent_dim=256, codebook=1024 â†’ 52.8M parameters
Recommended: latent_dim=128, codebook=512 â†’ ~13M parameters


Your model is too complex for CPU training, causing optimization difficulties.
4. Gradient Clipping (norm=1.0)

Current: No clipping â†’ Gradients can explode infinitely
Recommended: Clip at norm=1.0 â†’ Prevents gradient explosion
